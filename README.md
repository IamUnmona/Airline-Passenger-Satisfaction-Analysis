# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Analysis

Project Title: Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

Project Description: This project aims to analyze factors contributing to airline passenger satisfaction using machine learning models. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and includes various features like in-flight services, seat comfort, and passenger demographics.

Motivation: The airline industry is highly competitive, and understanding what drives passenger satisfaction can significantly impact business success. This analysis will provide insights into how airlines can improve their services and enhance customer loyalty.

Data Overview: The dataset contains records from 129,880 airline passengers and includes both categorical and numerical features such as age, gender, customer type, travel type, class, in-flight entertainment, and satisfaction ratings.

Methods Used:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Correlation analysis to understand the relationship between different features and passenger satisfaction.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
Model Selection and Tuning: Utilized various machine learning models including Decision Trees, KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Hyperparameters were tuned to optimize model performance.
Model Evaluation: Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Key Findings:

In-flight Wi-Fi service and online boarding efficiency are strongly correlated with higher passenger satisfaction.
Business class passengers tend to report higher satisfaction levels.
Arrival and departure delays have a negative impact on passenger satisfaction, although the correlation is relatively weak.
Usage: The insights derived from this project can be used by airlines to prioritize areas for improvement and enhance passenger satisfaction. This can lead to increased loyalty and potentially higher revenues.

Tech used:
Python
